# Overview


The software I wrote in this repository consists of 3 different 
programs: a simple Hello World program, a program that executes
expiramental code, and a tic tac toe program. 

The hello world program simply displays hello world to the terminal.

The practice program consists of tutorial software for learning rust.

the tic tac toe program plays the game of tic tac toe for two players.
Each player takes turns, and there is software to confirm user input so
that turn order does not get messed up.

My purpose for writing this software was to understand and learn the 
Rust language. Rust has a very special way of thinking, and I have 
heard that learning Rust often makes you more conciencious with memory 
ownership. Through making this game, I was able to learn the basics of 
Rust.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
Virtual Studio Code and its Rust extensions- Text editor
cargo- Rust compiler


-Rust

# Useful Websites

* [TutorialsPoint](www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/)
* [Rust Lang](rust-lang.org)

# Future Work

* Streamline user input and terminal output. Using flush felt sloppy.
* Make a GUI for the game to be played outside the terminal
* Display Board function works well, but it is all written out. 
this isn't an issue for a small 3x3 grid, but if the game were to be bigger, then the way it is written could become overwhelming.
